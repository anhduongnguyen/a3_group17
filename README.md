### Project Branching (Very Important)
we need to branch so that we're all not working on the main and mess everything up.

### git branch
this lists out all the branches

### git branch </branch/>
create a new branch with name </branch/>

### git chekout </branch/>
go to branch with name </branch/> 


## how to merge your branch to main and push:
#### PS: the "</ />" are just for syntaxing do not add them when doing the steps
#### Make sure you go into your branch first (steps 1 to 2)
### 1) git checkout </my branch name/> 
### 2) git pull origin main 
#### (do this when you go into your branch to pull changes made in main, it's good practice to do this even if nothing has changed as a double check) 
### After you're done coding in your branch: 
### 3) git add .
### 4) git commit -m "message" 
### 5) git checkout main (this takes you back to main)
### 6) git pull origin main 
### 7) git merge </my branch name/>
### 8) git push 

### If you want to just push your branch only to Github, use: git push origin </ your branch name/>
